# The Working Lives of Married Couples with "Lazy" Spouses

Inspired by the Kaggle scripting challenge using data from the 2013 American Community Survey, this is an R Markdown file (available in doc/final_draft.Rmd) exploring the relationship between income, education, and in particular the dynamics of families where only one out of two participants in the marriage tango are "in the labor force" (i.e. employed or actively seeking employment). 

This exploration was developed by myself, Yicheng Wang, Ao Liu and Yanyu Zhang from Columbia University in Spring 2016 for a class in Applied Data Science under Dr. Tian Zheng.
